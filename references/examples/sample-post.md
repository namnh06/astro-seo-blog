Buying your first home in Saskatchewan is exciting—but let's be honest, the mortgage process can feel overwhelming. Between down payments, pre-approvals, and closing costs, there's a lot to navigate.

In this guide, I'll walk you through everything first-time home buyers need to know, from understanding how much you can afford to the programs that can help you get into your home sooner. These are the same insights I share with Saskatchewan buyers every day.

> The minimum down payment in Canada is 5% for homes under $500,000. For homes between $500,000 and $1,500,000, you need 5% on the first $500,000 and 10% on the remaining amount.

## Understanding Your Budget

Before you start browsing listings, you need to know what you can actually afford. Lenders use two key ratios to determine this:

### What Lenders Look At

- **Gross Debt Service (GDS)**: Your housing costs shouldn't exceed 32% of gross income
- **Total Debt Service (TDS)**: All debts shouldn't exceed 40% of gross income
- **Credit score**: Most A-lenders want 680+, but options exist for lower scores

Use our [mortgage calculator](/mortgage-calculator) to get a quick estimate of what you might qualify for. Keep in mind this is just a starting point—your actual approval depends on your complete financial picture.

## Getting Pre-Approved

A pre-approval is one of the most important steps in the home buying process. It tells you exactly how much you can borrow and shows sellers you're a serious buyer.

Here's what you'll need for pre-approval:

- Recent pay stubs or proof of income
- T4s from the last two years
- Bank statements showing your down payment
- ID and Social Insurance Number
- Details on any existing debts

The pre-approval process typically takes 24-48 hours. Once approved, your rate is usually held for 90-120 days, protecting you if rates increase while you're house hunting.

## First-Time Buyer Programs in Saskatchewan

Saskatchewan first-time buyers have access to several programs that can make homeownership more affordable:

### Home Buyers' Plan (HBP)

You can withdraw up to $35,000 from your RRSP tax-free for a down payment. If you're buying with a partner, that's up to $70,000 combined. You have 15 years to repay it.

### First-Time Home Buyer Incentive (FTHBI)

The government provides 5% or 10% toward your down payment in exchange for a shared equity stake. This reduces your mortgage amount and monthly payments.

### First Home Savings Account (FHSA)

This newer program lets you save up to $8,000 per year (lifetime max $40,000) in a tax-advantaged account specifically for your first home purchase.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

After helping hundreds of Saskatchewan buyers, I've seen these mistakes come up repeatedly:

- **Not getting pre-approved first** - You might fall in love with a home you can't afford
- **Forgetting about closing costs** - Budget an extra 1.5-4% of the purchase price
- **Making big purchases before closing** - That new car could tank your approval
- **Not comparing mortgage options** - The lowest rate isn't always the best deal
- **Skipping the home inspection** - A $500 inspection could save you thousands
